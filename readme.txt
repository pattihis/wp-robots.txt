WP Robots Txt Allows you to edit the content of your robots.txt file.

== Description ==

WordPress, by default, includes a simple robots.txt file that's dynamically generated from within the WP application. This is great, but how do you easily change the content?

Enter **WP Robots Txt**, a plugin that adds an additional field to the "Reading" admin page where you can do just that. No manual coding or file editing required!

Simply visit https://your-site.com/wp-admin/options-reading.php and you can control the contents of your https://your-site.com/robots.txt

[Changelog](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-robots-txt/#developers)

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin
2. Unzip it
3. Upload the unzipped folder to `wp-content/plugins` directory
4. Activate and enjoy!

Or you can simply install it through the admin area plugin installer.

== Screenshots ==

1. A view of the admin option

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I totally screwed up my `robots.txt` file. How can I restore the default version? =

Delete all the content from the *Robots.txt Content* field and save the privacy options.

= Could I accidently block all search bots with this? =

Yes.  Be careful! That said, `robots.txt` files are suggestions. They don't really *block* bots as much as they *suggest* that bots don't crawl portions of a site.  That's why the options on the Privacy Settings page say "Ask search engines not to index this site."

= Where can I learn more about `robots.txt` files? =

[Here](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/robots_txt) is a general guide by Google and [here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/search-engine-optimization/) is the WordPress SEO documentation.
